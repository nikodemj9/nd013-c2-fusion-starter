### ID_S1_EX2
Example of cars with different visibility. As we can see some vehicles are visible only from front/side/rear and with different occlusion level.

Some features that are visible for most of the vehicles:
* roof (as it is rarely occluded, due to lidar sensor mounting point)
* wheels (for side viewed vehicles), 
* license plates (high reflectivity),
* lamps (additional source of light).
